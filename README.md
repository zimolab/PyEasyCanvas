# PyEasyCanvas

This is a python port of the EasyCanvas created by douzhongqiang. You can find the original code here: [EasyCanvas](https://github.com/douzhongqiang/EasyCanvas).

This is not a 1:1 port, only the core components of EasyCanvas are ported. The purpose of this port is to provide a 
powerful and easy-to-use canvas widget for graphical viewing and editing for python qt users, rather than make a 
full-fledged drawing application like original EasyCanvas.
